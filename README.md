- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [PDF](#PDF)


## Introduction ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of Python implementations and exercises focusing on different data structures. By working through this, you'll gain a deep understanding of the fundamental building blocks of computer science.


python
# Example usage
from data_structures import LinkedList

# Create a linked list
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.insert(5)
linked_list.insert(10)
linked_list.display()
```

## PDF

I've also included a pdf in this repository that you can use for additional practice. You can download and run it in your own environment.

Feel free to dive into the code and deepen your understanding of data structures! If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
